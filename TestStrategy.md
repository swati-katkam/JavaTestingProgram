## 3. Scope of Testing
### ‚úÖ In Scope
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing
- Integration Testing
- API Testing
- UI Testing (Web/Desktop/Mobile)
- Smoke and Sanity Testing

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

## 4. Testing Types & Approach
| Testing Type       | Approach Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Functional Testing | Verify features against requirements |
| Regression Testing | Re-test unchanged features to ensure existing functionality is not broken |
| API Testing        | Use Postman/RestAssured for testing backend services |
| UI Automation      | Use Selenium/Cypress to automate UI flows |
| Integration Testing| Verify interaction between modules and services |

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
| Risk                            | Mitigation Strategy                       |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Delay in test environment setup | Plan early and have backup environment     |
| Requirements change mid-cycle   | Impact analysis and test re-alignment      |
| Lack of skilled test resources  | Cross-train team members                   |
